**Appearence**

Demons are medium sized, biped creatures. notable features include four
fingered hands with thick claws, bioluminescent eyes, horns, long hairless
tails, and thick hides covered in fur. Yellow eyeballs with cat like pulps.
they have faint bioluminescent irises; in sunlight they appear fully grey while
at night take on red or purple hue.

Demons are taller than most ancestries, typically between 1.8 and 2.6 metres
tall.

**Origin**

Demons have an enigmatic origin as no text describes their origin in detail,
some speculate Demons have arrive during the second age. the first sighting of
Demons appeared in 2-012 where a farmboy who had ran off into the woods saw an
odd-looking red skinned woman hunting deer in the forest. Demons initially
settled in small communites on the mainlands just below the northern isles
after an age they have intermixed with the other ancestries. lot of people tend
to be less accepting of Demons especially down in regions where Demons are
rarely seen such as the south and remote montinous areas.
