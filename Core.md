
# The Basics

Lets start with the roles at the table. One can take two prominent roles at the table Game Master
or Player

## Game Master

Typically, there is only 1 Game Master at the table, but more than one can be assigned to the role.
The Game Master's role is to adjudicate rules and provide descriptions of non Players characters
and their behaviours, scenarios, and the world in which the Players find themselves in. Further
information about the duties of the Game Master and the resources available to them are
explained in the Game Master section. The game master plays most of the creatures in the game.

### Creatures

Creatures are living or formerly living beings controlled by the Game Master or Players. These
Creatures have personalities, ethics, and preferences. Creatures can see and hear things around
them.

### Gamemaster's Goal

The Game Master's goal is to provide a enjoyable experience to themselves and their Players. this
is typically achieved by allowing players to have agency in the world by letting them fulfill their
goals. Game master's are encurraged to challenge the Players with interesting encounters and
scenarios.

## Player

Everybody other than the Game Master at the table is considered a Player; there are between 1
and 6 Players at a table. The Player's role is to interact with the world, characters and scenarios the
Game Master creates through their Character's eyes, feelings, and actions. Each Player plays a
Character of their choice. Characters are explained more below and in the Character Creation
section.

### Characters

Characters are sentient creatures controlled by Players that are not summoned creatures or
familiars. Characters interact with the world the Game Master creates. Characters are customizable
and are discussed further in the Character Creation section.

**Player's Goal**

the goal of the Players is to fulfill their Character's abmitions and satisfy their lifestyles. Players
should seek to use their agency to change the world for the better of worse. Gigs and other
various activities allow Players to fulfill their character's needs as well as let them earn money in the
meantime.

### Gigs

Gigs are missions Players can choose to take on, these can be complex, simple or anything in
between. Gigs are set up by Fixers that typically reward Mercinaries with money, information, or
equipment. Certain gigs reward you more if you complete optional objectives and conform to set
deadlines.

## Checks

Checks are used as a resolution mechanic, Checks are made using a twelve sided dice or a d12.
Checks have 3 Complexities: Simple, Advanced and Complex; the Check's complexity determines
the target values.

when you make a Check, you must score a value equal to or higher than the target value to score a
success.

To make a Checks, roll multiple dice equal to your Attribute's value. count the
number of dice that scored the success value specified by the Check's
Complexity the more dice that score a success the better the outcome.

### Fumbles

A Fumble is a result of 1 on a d12, each fumble you score removes 1 success.

### Simple Checks

Simple Checks require you to score a 7 or higher to succeed. Simple checks do not count fumbles.

### Advanced Checks

Advanced Checks require you to score a 9 or higher to succeed.

### Complex Checks

Complex Checks require you to score a 11 or higher to succeed;

## Stress

Stress represents a Character's the mental Fatique from life. A character has 0 Stress at Character

Creation. A Character can choose to gain 1 Stress to roll additional dice equal to one of your
Attributes on a Skill Check as your game master which they think applies most. Stress slowly
recovers when performing specific downtime tasks. when you gain 15 Stress, your character has a
mental breakdown and will flee regardless if that results in their death, you lose control of You
Character and must retire them.

## Items

Items are tangible objects of any size that are not alive, sentient or possessed by a creature. Items
have a Base Value, the base value determines how much the item costs to craft and how much it
costs to purchase at character creation. Items can have a Upkeep Cost, the Upkeep Cost refers to
the price you must pay to continue using the item after completing a Gig, if you do not pay the
price you will not be able to use the item until you do.
the Prices of items can fluctuated based on in world events and stocks, the Game Master can set
the price of items as they see fit so long as it is within reason. The Game master should provide a
reason as to why the items are priced as such if the Players Enquire about it, such as discounts or
Taxes.

achievements, from Technology Level 1 (the Stone Age) to Technology Level 11
