Lets start with the roles at the table. One can take two prominent roles at the
table Game Master or Player

# Game Master

Typically, there is only 1 Game Master at the table, but more than one can be
assigned to the role. The Game Master's role is to adjudicate rules and provide
descriptions of non Players characters, scenarios, and the world in which the
Players find themselves in. Further information about the duties of the Game
Master and the resources available to them are explained in the Game Master
section. The game master plays most of the creatures in the game.

The Game Master's goal is to provide an enjoyable experience to themselves and
their Players. This is typically achieved by allowing players to have agency in
the world by letting them fulfill their goals. Game master's are encouraged to
challenge the Players with interesting encounters and scenarios.

# Player

Everybody other than the Game Master at the table is considered a Player; there
are between 1 and 6 Players at a table. The Player's role is to interact with
the world, characters and scenarios the Game Master creates through their
Character's eyes, feelings, and actions. Each Player plays a Character of their
choice. Characters are explained more below and in the Character Creation
section.

The goal of the Players is to fulfill their Character's ambitions and satisfy
their lifestyles. Players should seek to use their agency to change the world
for the better of worse. Gigs and other various activities allow Players to
fulfill their character's needs as well as let them earn money in the meantime.
